This is the source distribution of the 
programming language WetL. At this point
the prototype is merely a play language
that cannot interact with it's environment.
This might be changed in the future.

The following shows the contained files
and their meaning.

- dyn_arr.c
	Implements dynamically growing Arrays

- id_table.c
	Implements functions for id-table
	manipulation used by interpreter.c

- iwetlex.c iwetparse.c iwetparse.h
  werlex.c wetparse.c wetparse.h
	Generated by flex and bison. ***lex.c
	are scanner-, **parse.c are parser
	implementation files

- logger.c
	Implements a very simple logging 
	interface

- main.c
	Glues everything together

- mem_alloc.c
	Provides structure buffer functions
	used by the interpreter function
	called parse_expression() and parse_
	assignment()

- nary_tree.c
	Simple implementation of nary-trees

- parser.h 
	The distributions header file

- parser.y
	The bison parser file for non-interactive
	usage

- iparser.y 
	The bison parser file for interactive
	usage

- iscanner.l
	Flex sourcecode for an scanner version
	for interactive environments

- scanner.l
	Flex sourcecode for an scanner for non-
	interactive usage

- parser_util
	Holds various functions used inside
	of the file parser.y

- scanner_util.c
	Implements some functions used inside
	of the scanner files scanner.l and 
	iscanner.l

- settings.c
	Implements a singleton which encapsulates
	the complexity of command line argument
	parsing

- sl_list.c
	Implements a singly linked list ADT

- sl_stack.c
	Implements a stack ADT based on a
	singly linked list

- str_dyn.c
	Provides functions for dynamically
	growing strings
